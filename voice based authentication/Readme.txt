Voice-Based Authentication System:

Overview:
The Voice-Based Authentication System provides a secure and interactive way of verifying user identities using voice recognition. By enrolling a user's voice as a unique biometric identifier, the system can authenticate users by comparing real-time voice input against the stored voiceprint.

Key Features:

    Voice Enrollment:

        Users can enroll their voiceprints by recording their voice. The system captures key features of the voice and stores them as a digital voiceprint.

        The voiceprint is saved as a .npy (NumPy) file, which can be used for future authentication attempts.

    Voice Authentication:

        To authenticate, the system records a new voice sample and compares it against the stored voiceprint of the enrolled user.

        A similarity score is calculated using cosine similarity between the new voice features and the stored voiceprint.

        Authentication is successful if the similarity score exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.85), indicating a match.

    Threshold-based Authentication:

        The system uses a similarity score to decide whether authentication is successful or not.

        A minimum similarity threshold (e.g., 0.85) is set, below which authentication will fail.

    User Feedback:

        Users receive feedback about their authentication attempt, including the similarity score and whether the attempt was successful.

        In case of failure (due to a low similarity score or missing user enrollment), appropriate error messages are shown.

    Error Handling:

        If an attempt is made to authenticate a user who has not enrolled, the system prompts the user to first complete the enrollment process.

        Invalid input choices (for example, selecting an option outside the expected choices) are handled gracefully, prompting users to try again.

Technology Stack:

    Librosa: A Python package for audio and speech analysis, used to extract MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) features from recorded audio for voice comparison.

    SoundDevice: A library for recording audio from the microphone.

    NumPy: Used to store voiceprints as arrays and calculate the similarity score.

    Scikit-learn: Provides cosine_similarity for comparing voiceprints.

    Wave File Handling: Audio is recorded as .wav files and processed for analysis.

Workflow:

    Enrollment: The user records a voice sample, which is processed into a voiceprint (MFCC features) and saved.

    Authentication: The user speaks into the microphone. The voice sample is compared to the stored voiceprint. If the similarity score is above the threshold, authentication is successful. If not, the user is notified.

Security Considerations:

    Voiceprint Storage: Voiceprints are stored locally as .npy files, offering basic protection through file system permissions. Additional encryption can be added for extra security.

    Robustness: The system uses robust audio feature extraction methods (MFCC) to ensure that small variations in voice or background noise do not significantly affect the authentication process.

Applications:

    Personal Authentication: This system is ideal for systems requiring quick, hands-free, and secure user identification, such as in smart devices, banking, or access control systems.

    Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): It can be integrated into multi-factor authentication systems to enhance security by combining voice recognition with other methods like passwords or PINs.

How to Use:

    Enroll a User:

        Choose option [1] Enroll and speak when prompted. Your voice will be recorded and saved as your unique voiceprint.

    Authenticate a User:

        Choose option [2] Authenticate, enter your username, and speak when prompted. Your voice will be compared to the stored voiceprint. If the similarity is high enough, authentication will be successful.

Example Interaction:

üéôÔ∏è  Voice-Based Authentication System

Choose: [1] Enroll  [2] Authenticate:  2
Enter username: alice

Recording... Speak now.
Recording complete.
[i] Similarity score: 1.00
[‚úî] Authentication successful!

If the similarity score is below the threshold:

[i] Similarity score: 0.72
[‚úò] Authentication failed. The voice input does not match the registered voice.
